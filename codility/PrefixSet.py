#         A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The first covering prefix of array A is the smallest integer P such that 0≤P<N and such that every value that occurs in array A also occurs in sequence A[0], A[1], ..., A[P].

# For example, the first covering prefix of the following 5−element array A:

#   A[0] = 2
#   A[1] = 2
#   A[2] = 1
#   A[3] = 0
#   A[4] = 1
# is 3, because sequence [ A[0], A[1], A[2], A[3] ] equal to [2, 2, 1, 0], contains all values that occur in array A.

# Write a function

# def solution(A)

# that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the first covering prefix of A.

# For example, given array A such that

#   A[0] = 2
#   A[1] = 2
#   A[2] = 1
#   A[3] = 0
#   A[4] = 1
# the function should return 3, as explained above.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..N-1].
